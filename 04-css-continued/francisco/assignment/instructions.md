# Instructions

1. Downoad the "Live Server" extension for VSCode. This will allow us to spin up a local development server to serve our webpages as if they were deployed on a remote server. Be sure to read through the extension's documentation on how to use it within VSCode.

2. Make a new git repository on Github to house your new project.

3. Use VSCode's 'Command Palette' (Ctrl+Shift+P) -> 'Git:Clone' -> Paste your repository url in the prompt, select the folder you want to clone your repo. Your repository will be cloned.

4. VSCode will create a folder with your project name in that location - and everything in that folder will be connected to your remote repository. You can then add (stage), commit and push your code to Github directly via VSCode. To toggle the Integrated Git within VSCode to perform those actions, use the sidebar or use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+G)

5. Create an index.html that houses your About page.

6. Create a folder called 'portfolio' inside your project directory. Inside of it, create an index.html file that will house your "Portfolio" page. See the mockup for the Portfolio specs. A user should be able to navigate using the links in the header to go to the Portfolio page from the About page, and vice versa.

7. Develop both the About and Portfolio pages trying your best to get as close to the [mockup](./mockup.pdf) as possible. Use the tools we have covered thus far (floats) to construct your pages. You will need to research CSS that we have not covered thus far (e.g. linear-gradients, box-shadow, etc.) as well as how to link to other pages using `a` tags.

8. Utilize external stylesheets, relative paths for stylesheets, images, etc.

9. To submit your project, send a direct message in Slack to your instructor with two links: 1) the url to your project's git repo on github, and 2) the url of your deployed site (using Github Pages).(To deploy your site using Github Pages, go to the 'Settings' tab of your repo, scroll down to the heading 'Githube Pages', and select the master branch as the 'Source' of your page. Be sure to refresh this page until the deployment message is green. Then, click the URL of your deployed page and see it live.)

10. Good luck!
