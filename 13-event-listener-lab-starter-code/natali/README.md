# Planet Listener Lab

## 1

Your primary objective in this lab is to:
- listen for when the user is typing in the input box
- if what the user has typed is equal to a given planet name -> change the background photo to that planet
- if what the user doesn't match a planet name, change the background photo to the 404.jpg image


## Bonus

Wrap all of your JavaScript in an event listener that "waits until the DOM is loaded".

You'll need to research this.
